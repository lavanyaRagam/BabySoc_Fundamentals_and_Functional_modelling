# BabySoc Fundamentals And Functional Modelling

**BabySoC Fundamentals and Functional Modelling** involves understanding and designing a small-scale **System-on-Chip (SoC)** to explore the core principles of SoC architecture, integration, and verification.

### Fundamentals
Focuses on the key concepts of SoC design, including:  
- Processor cores  
- Memory interfaces  
- Peripheral integration  
- Clocking and reset mechanisms  

It explains how each component interacts within a single chip and how **data and control signals flow** between modules.

### Functional Modelling
Emphasizes creating **behavioral and structural models** of the SoC in **HDL (Verilog/SystemVerilog)**.  
This step simulates the SoC‚Äôs operation before synthesis, allowing verification of:  
- Design logic  
- Timing  
- Inter-module communication  

### Learning Outcomes
- Understand the **hierarchy and components** of a minimal SoC.  
- Develop and **simulate a processor core** with basic peripherals.  
- Perform **functional verification** using testbenches and waveform analysis.  
- Gain **hands-on experience** in translating SoC specifications into HDL models for simulation.
